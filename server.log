2025-01-08 00:54:30,567 [INFO] src.luna_functions_handledispatch: @lunabot:localhost: Macarons are sweet meringue-based confections made with egg white, icing sugar, granulated sugar, almond meal, and food coloring. The macaron is commonly filled with ganache, buttercream or jam filling sandwiched between two cookies. Its name is derived from the Italian word "macarone, maccarone or maccherone", all means "meringue".

The macaron is often mistaken with macaroon, which is a completely different cookie. Originated in France, it's considered one of the most famous pastries in the country, especially the ones from Ladurée in Paris.

Macarons can be found in a wide variety of flavors that range from the traditional (raspberry, chocolate) to the unusual (foie gras, matcha). They are known for their smooth, squared top, ruffled circumference (referred to as the "foot"), and a flat base. It's lightly crisp on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside, with a rich filling. 

Making macarons is considered to be quite delicate due to the specificity of each ingredient and the technique of making the meringue, but with practice, it's definitely possible to master at home!
